# Python Module for FreeNAS Websocket API

This python module utilizes the [FreeNAS Websocket API](https://api.ixsystems.com/freenas/) to get state from a FreeNAS instance.

## Installation

```
pip install pyfreenas
```

## Usage

```python
from pyfreenas import CachingMachine as FreeNASMachine

machine = await FreeNASMachine.create(
    "hostname.of.machine",
    username="someuser",
    password="password",
)
disks = await machine.get_disks()
pools = await machine.get_pools()
vms = await machine.get_vms()
```

### `Machine`

Object representing a FreeNAS instance.

### `Disk`

Available from `machine.disks`, contains information about the disks attached to the machine.

### `Pool`

Available from `machine.pools`, contains information about the ZFS pools known to the machine.

### `VirturalMachine`

Available from `machine.vms`, contains information about the virtural machines available on the machine.

Each instance has the following methods availabe:
* `vm.start`
* `vm.stop`
* `vm.restart`

## Development

### Setup

```
python3.8 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Dev Requirements
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# One-Time Install of Commit Hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Working With Methods

When adding support for a new object, or updating existing code, it can be useful to see the raw response from the
FreeNAS machine from time to time.  In order to help do that easily, you can drop a `.auth.yaml` file in the root of
the repository, with the following content:

```
host: "some.host.name"
username: "someuser"
password: "somepassword"
```

Then use `invoke_method.py` to call a method:

```
python invoke_method.py disk.query
```

Run it with -h to see additional options.
